# Basics of R

* It is completely free and open source
* It is faster and more efficient with memory
* It facilitates easier replication of analysis
* It has a large and growing global community of active users

## How to start using R
Rstudio is an IDE *Integrated Development Environment* that is most popular for R

## DATA IN R
Simple calculations can be done easily but R does not store result

* To store something in R session, assign it a name using the ( <- ) operator
* To display value, use print() command given that name of the object must be inside
* To see type of single scalar value, use typeof() function
* To display both the contents of the vector and its type,  use str() function
  
  
## **CODE SNIPPETS**

### Store result

my_sum <- 3+3

my_sum +3

[1] 9

### Define a value to an object r does not show the result

my_sum

(another_sum <- my_sum +3)

[1] 9


***To explore data types in r,define integer in R***

### Integers can be signified by adding an 'L' o the end

my_integer <- 1L

my_double <- 6.38

typeof(my_integer)

[1] "integer"

typeof(my_double)

[1] "double"


### Show how to assign character object 

my_character <- "THIS IS TEXT"

typeof(my_character)

[1] "character"

## LOGICAL DATA - logical object values are either true or false

my_logical <- TRUE

typeof(my_logical)


#HOMOGENOUS VECTORS

## VECTORS - define a vector object use command c(), shows the type of vector, index and its elements

my_double_vector <- c(2.3, 6.8, 4.5, 65, 6)

str(my_double_vector)


### Categorical data, vector and factor type

categories <- factor(c("A", "B", "C", "A", "C"))

str(categories)

categories_char <- c("A", "B", "C", "A", "C")

str(categories_char)


### Ordered factor vector use command ordered, with character vector and its level

ranking <- c("Medium", "High", "Low")

str(ranking)

ranking_factors <- ordered(ranking, levels = c("Low","Medium" , "High"))

str(ranking_factors)


### For any vector you want to find the number of elements length()

length(categories)


### Create a seq of numbers we use this notation, useful when doing simulations

(my_sequence <- 1:10)

(my_sequence_two <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 5))


### Demonstrates type coercion occurs to have a homogenous type since vectors are 

#Numeric vector

vec <- 1:5

str(vec)


#Create a new vector containing vec and the character hello

new_vec <- c(vec, "hello")


#Numeric values have been coerced into their character equivalents

str(new_vec)


### Another type of coercion a mixed logical ang numeric

mix <- c( TRUE, 6)


#A logical has been converted to binary numeric true=1

str(mix)

new_categories <- c(categories, 1)

str(new_categories)


### Define a matrix, thus recycles elements when number of columns does not coincide

(m <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2))

(m <- matrix(vec, nrow=5,ncol=2))


### Vectors do not allow different type of elements however, list allow different types of elements

my_list <- list(6, TRUE, "hello")

str(my_list)

//

new_list <- list(
  scalar = 6, vector = c("Hello", "Goodbye"), matrix= matrix(1:4, nrow=2,ncol=2))
  
str(new_list)

new_list$matrix

new_list$vec

new_list[[2]]



## DATAFRAMES - most used data structure in R/ spreadsheets

### to create a dataframe

names <- c("John", "Ayesha")

ages <- c(31, 24)


### create a dataframe, get the type of columns and the dimensions of df

(df <- data.frame(names, ages))

str(df)

dim(df)


## Working with dataframes

data() to access data sets in R


## Import data int R 

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msuiitdmsgabriel/datasets-regression/main/salespeople.csv"

salespeople <- read.csv(url)


### Display dimensions of dataframes (rows and columns), head displays first few rows

dim(salespeople)

head(salespeople)


### View specific entry of a column 

salespeople$sales[6]


### Use a [row, column] index to get specific entry i the dataframe

salespeople[34,4]

str(salespeople)


### Statistical summary 

summary(salespeople)


### is.na function return true or false based on NA values in a dataframe

is.na(salespeople)

sum(is.na(salespeople))


### Remove rows with NA

#### Tells if particular row if complete or not

complete.cases(salespeople) 

salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople),] 


#### Overwrite the dataframe creating a new fame with complete values

salespeople <- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople),] 

sum(is.na(salespeople))


### Unique values of a vector or column

unique(salespeople$performance)


### Take a look on entire column

salespeople$performance


### change of type of column

#### Get vector and convert into factor 

as.factor(salespeople$performance)

salespeople$performance <- as.factor(salespeople$performance)

str(salespeople)


## Manipulating dataframes

### Subset command

(sales_720 <- subset(salespeople, subset = sales == 720))



#### == To test for precise equality


####  Other inequalities used

high_sales <- subset(salespeople, subset =sales >= 700)

head(high_sales)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msuiitdmsgabriel/datasets-regression/main/salespeople.csv"

salespeople <- read.csv(url)

salespeople <- salespeople[complete.cases(salespeople),] 

high_sales <- subset(salespeople, subset =sales >= 700)

//
low_sales <- subset(salespeople, subset = sales < 400)

low_and_high_sales = rbind(low_sales, high_sales)

head(low_and_high_sales)



## Combining two dataframes of two different names by its column, c bind function

sales_perf <- subset(salespeople, select = c("sales", "performance"))

prom_custrate <- subset(salespeople, select = c("promoted", "customer_rate" ))

full_df <- cbind(sales_perf, prom_custrate)

head(full_df)



## Using Functions


Head function 

head(required argment, optional argument)

head(x = salespeople)

head(x = salespeople, n=4)


head(salespeople, 6)
 

head(salespeople, 3)

 
head(n=3, x = salespeople)



***Display help page in browser***

?head

help(head)

###Help page shows

description of the purpose of the function

##writing functions in R

functions are not limited, thus one can write functions

DRY Do not Repeat Yourself Principle

## A simple function written which generates a report on a dataframe

df_report function

df_report <- function(df) {paste( "This dataframe contains", nrow(df), "rows and", ncol(df), "columns. There are", sum(is.na(df)), "NA entries.")}

 df_report(mtcars)
 
[1] "This dataframe contains 32 rows and 11 columns. \n    There are 0 NA entries."

### Paste function compiles two or many strigs into a single string

paste("This is how the paste"," function works")

[1] "This is how the paste  function works"

## Installing Packages

MASS package
install.packages() using this command to install packages

install more than oe package define it as a vector

my_packages <- c("DescTools", "dplyr")
install.packages(my_packages)

see what functions are available in package use help(package = "MASS")
to use functions upload to r session use library(MASS) 

functions 'belong' to package

As an example

sales <- subset(salespeople, subset = sales < 500)

subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales < 500)

mean(sales$sales)


####**mean(subset(salespeople, subset = sales < 500)$sales)**

**subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales < 500) %>% mean()**


####**round(mean(subset(salespeople, subset = sales < 500)$sales))**

**subset(salespeople$sales, subset = salespeople$sales < 500) %>% mean() %>% round()**

subset(salespeople, subset = sales = 720)
Error: unexpected '=' in "subset(salespeople, subset = sales ="
 head[salespeople]
Error in head[salespeople] : object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
 head(SALE)
Error in head(SALE) : object 'SALE' not found
 head(salespeople)


plot and graph

scatter plot
plot(x= salespeople$scales,y = salespeople$customer_rate,xlab = "Sales ($m)",ylab = "Average customer rating",)
